## Using

This package cannot be used directly. It is a container to provide centralized fallback for community health files for the `wp-cli` Github organization.

See: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization)

### GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows that are automatically synced to all WP-CLI repositories:

- **Code Quality Checks** (`code-quality.yml`) - Runs linting, PHPCS, PHPStan, and other code quality tools
- **Regenerate README** (`regenerate-readme.yml`) - Automatically regenerates README.md files from source
- **Check Branch Alias** (`check-branch-alias.yml`) - Monitors and updates Composer branch-alias configuration

#### Branch Alias Checker

The branch alias checker workflow automatically ensures that the Composer `branch-alias` in each repository's `composer.json` is up-to-date. It:

1. Runs weekly (every Monday at 2 AM UTC) or can be triggered manually
2. Checks the latest release tag
3. Calculates the expected branch-alias (next minor version after the latest release)
4. Compares with the current branch-alias
5. Creates a pull request if an update is needed

For example, if a repository has released version `2.12.0`, the branch-alias should be set to `2.13.x-dev` to point to the next development version.
